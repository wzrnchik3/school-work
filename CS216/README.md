# CS216 - Intro To Software Engineering Fall 2018

## Lab8
---
#### Program that reads in UK building list and then sorts them in a order decided by the user. Text file passed in via command line arguments. Implementation of a building class and a buildingList class.

## Lab10F
---
#### Labs purpose was to implement operator overloads.

## Lab11
---
#### Using a made graph class, create algorithms to calculate the shortest distance of each vertex to the source, given by user.

## Lab12
---
#### Continuation of Lab 11 using the graph class to not only find the shortest distance, but also find the vertexes to go through to get to the source.

## PA1 - **Project 1**
---
#### Using an implemented imdb class, read in a text file with actor names and movies via command line argument. When this is read in, allow the user to either analyze actors in two different movies, such as actors in both, one or the other, or actors in either movie. Also allow the user to have the option to enter an actor and display the movies him/her were in and their coactors.

## PA2 - **Project 2**
---
#### This project was used to create and implement the term class. This was done by reading in a text file arg and using that to populate vectors. Then using the created sortingList class and autocomplete classes create a program to search them.

## PA3 - **Project 3**
---
#### Using the created graph class, along with inputted text files with movies and actors, build a graph and use that as a sort of Bacon Number machine. Given an actor it will show the Bacon Number for them, along with the movies they played in with the next actor/vertex to Kevin Bacon.
