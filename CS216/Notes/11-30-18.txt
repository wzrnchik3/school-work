## Do Teacher Evaluation for CS216

# Finish project
    Need to finish main
    Graph class is done

    All data is already done. Only build graph one time.
    Find vertex

    What kind of data structures I should use to store a large number
    of data items for my Project 3?
        - Using the third input file, figure out which actors are in the same movies
        - Kevin Bacon will be used as source for every vertex in the graph
        - Go through will store next actor on shortest path to KB

    
    Based on the operations
        - What should be the label for each vertex?
        - look up the actorID --> return vertex label
        - look up the actorID --> return actorName
        - look up the movieID --> return movieTitle
        - look up the actorName --> return vertex label
            - Use map (?) maybe multiple maps or maybe something better
        - and so on.. keep asking questions of better ways for data structures

    ## Project due on Monday!!!!

# Algorithm Efficiency
    Seldom a single algorithm for any problem
    Compare different algorithms that solve the same problem
        - Analyze the algorithm Efficiency
            - time complexity
            - space complexity
        - Choose the algorithm that is an order of magnitude more efficient
    How t measure the time and space complexities of algorithms?
     - Time complexity is the total # of basic operations required by the algorithm
